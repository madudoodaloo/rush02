> argc
2 - prints based on the standard dictionary
3 - takes a new dict, adds the contents to our standard and then prints
2 - if av[1] == "-", read from input, after enter, print the number

if (ac == 1 || ac > 3)
> upon error, print with expected cmdline options to run the program 

parse the given number
> must be a positive int (>= 0)
> no signs, no decimals, just numbers
> edge case for bonus: if av[1] == "-"

dictionary expected syntax:
> [a number][0 to n spaces]:[0 to n spaces][any printable characters]\n

parse and store the given dictionary
> trim the spaces
> the given reference dictionary must always be considered
> if a new dict is added, new keys should be added with the accordingly values,
new values to the same keys should be updated
> there can be empty lines in the dictionary
> errors while parsing the dictionary should display "Dict Error\n" 
> if the dictionary does not allow you to perform the conversion of the provided
number, your program must output "Dict Error\n".
